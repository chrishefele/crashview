# CrashView

## Introduction
Crashview is a project run by Code For Princeton that focuses on visualizing the location of bicycle crashes in the Princeton area.  The code in this repository focuses on preparing the dataset -- specifically, geocoding the location information when GPS location data is not available -- to allow it to be easily mapped with GIS tools.
